Biceps - Hammer Curls^While holding the upper arm stationary, alternate curling weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Continue the movement until your biceps arefully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
Triceps - Bench Dips^Place a bench behind your back. With the bench perpendicular to your body, and while looking away from it, hold on to the bench on its edge with the hands fully extended, separated at shoulder width. The legs will be extended forward, bent at the waist and perpendicular to your torso.Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. 
Triceps - Band Skull Crushers^Secure a band to the base of a rack or the bench. Lay on the bench so that the band is lined up with your head. Take hold of the band, raising your elbows so that the upper arm is perpendicular to the floor. With the elbow flexed, the band should be above your head. Extend through the elbow to straighten your arm, keeping your upper arm in place. Pause at the top of the motion, and return to the starting position.
